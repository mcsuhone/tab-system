5. Create backup script through dockers that runs daily at 12:00 and keeps backups for 30 days

6. Add advanced search logic

- Use a fuzzy search to search for products
- Order products by popularity (this needs to be implemented somehow in the database, could be popularity score in products table that gets updated when a product is sold, with some calculation), this should reflect popularity of the product in the last 2 weeks, which is compared to other products sold in the time period.

7. Add a "top drinks" section to the products page include fire emoji

- This includes "most popular" drinks based on sales
