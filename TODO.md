1. Account page logs

- Make these statistics work

2. Finish admin page activity

- display last activity from all users
- add filtering of this data by date (using date-picker)

3. Add a "tap beer" and "open price" buttons to the product page, that allow user to purchase with open prices.

- Figure out how to do this, so that logging works and we dont display these as duplicates in product list

4. Fix Admin page to not be visible for default users
