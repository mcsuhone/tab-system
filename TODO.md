TODO:

3. Add "annoskoko" to drinks page

4. Create backup script through dockers that runs daily at 12:00 and keeps backups for 30 days

5. Add advanced search logic

- Use a fuzzy search to search for products
- Order products by popularity (this needs to be implemented somehow in the database, could be popularity score in products table that gets updated when a product is sold, with some calculation), this should reflect popularity of the product in the last 2 weeks, which is compared to other products sold in the time period.

6. Add a "top drinks" section to the products page include fire emoji

- This includes "most popular" drinks based on sales

7. Fix searching in users admin page ,,,,

8. Add "auto logout" button to login page

9. Maybe add some cool animation for logging in?
