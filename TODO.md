1. Make authentication actually work

- Currently, logging in doesnt really work
- We just create some very permanent jwt token
- Make it also log user out after checking out a shopping cart

2. Make pagecontainer component to make all pages have the same layout in terms of content

3. Fix account page logs

4. Finish admin side

- Add permission to users table
- Only admins will see "admin" in the sidebar
- Add admin page for adding products and users
- Add admin page to look at activity throughout all users
- Add useful filtering for example, who visited on certain dates etc.
