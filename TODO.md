1. Fix toasts!!

2. Create logic to import and export data from CSV:s

3. Create backup logic

4. Add advanced search logic

- Use a fuzzy search to search for products
- Order products by popularity (this needs to be implemented somehow in the database, could be popularity score in products table that gets updated when a product is sold, with some calculation), this should reflect popularity of the product in the last 2 weeks, which is compared to other products sold in the time period.
